Welcome to Nation, Inc

Sign up to your brand new virtual citizenship.

Nation, Inc is a decentralized, unaffiliated cross-study of political theory, human rights, morality, and technology.

We don't believe that the concept of the nation-state is applicable anymore.

Our goal is to debate, develop, and deploy an alternative, opt-in, decentralized government system, one that is more closely adapted for the realities of the 21st century.

We aim at setting a strong framework based on established human rights conventions, open-source technology, and fresh political thinking.


On participation
==========

Everyone is encouraged to participate.

We need the help of software coders, law practitioners, political thinkers, human rights activists, writers, designers, economists, psychologists, artists, communications, and more.
